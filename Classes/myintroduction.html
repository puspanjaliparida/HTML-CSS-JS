    <h1><i>My Introduction</i></h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm <b>Puspanjali Parida</b>, and I'm diving into the exciting world of <u>HTML</u>! <br>
        <hr><br>
        As a new learner, I am enthusiastic about understanding how web pages are created and structured using HTML. I am eager to explore the various tags, elements, and attributes that make up the backbone of web development. Through practice and experimentation, I aim to build my skills in crafting well-designed and functional web pages. I look forward to the journey ahead as I delve deeper into HTML and expand my knowledge of web development technologies.</p>
