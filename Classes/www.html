    <p>The World Wide Web (known as "WWW', "Web" or "W3") is the universe of network-accessible information, the embodiment of human knowledge.</p>
    <p>The World Wide Web began as a networked information project at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a>, where Tim Berners-Lee, now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C], developed a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Summary.html">vision</a> of the project.</p>
    <p>The Web has a body of software, and a set of protocols and conventions. Through the use hypertext and multimedia techniques, the web is easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute to. An early <a href="https://www.w3.org/Talks/General.html">talk</a> about the Web gives some more background on how the Web was originally conceived.</p>

<p><b>How can I help?</b></p>
<p>There are lots of ways you can help the development of the World Wide Web.</p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/">Put up some data</a>
<p>There are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/">more details</a> , <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/Etiquette.html">etiquette</a> , <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/">style guide</a>.</p>
<p>Suggest that someone else does</p>
<p>Maybe you know a system or some information which you would like to see on the web. Suggest to the person involved that they put up a W3 server.</p>
<p>Manage a subject area</p>
<p>If you know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?</p>
